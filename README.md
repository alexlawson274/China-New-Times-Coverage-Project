# Is China's economy followed closely enough?
China makes up roughly 17% of the world's economy in 2025. Has Western media's coverage of China kept pace with the country's growth? 

##  Methodology
Using the New York Times Article Search API (see source data below), I counted how many articles mention "China" in a given year. I then compared the amount of coverage China receives in the New York Times to that of other major economies. 

<b>How the New York Times International Coverage Index is Calculated for 2024:</b>
###-> Count the mentions for each of the top 20 economies in the world (by GDP)
-> Calculate the average of the top 20 country mentions. 
-> Divide each country by the average of the top 20. 

This gives the New York Times International Coverage Index (1= low coverage, 3= high coverage) 

Why use this index? 

Variability in country mentions: Country mentions fluctuate year-to-year. This may be due in part to the structure of the newspaper (how many articles are in the paper, the length, use of newswires, etc). Using an index, rather than a year-to-year count, means that different years can be compared (for example, 2005 and 2024). 

Simplicity: An index of international coverage is easier for readers to grasp (other methods to show international coverage, for example, % of total country mentions, can be confusing)

Other Notes: Take note of the search term for the country. A country search for the country "Turkey" may return articles about Thanksgiving. 


##  Source Data 
Data comes from the Article Search API.T The Api allows users to look up articles by keyword. You can refine your search using filters.

## Dependencies
Before running the script, the following packages need to be installed:.

- `Datetime`

##  Output
The calculations were used as part of an article titled "Is China's Economy Followed Closely Enough?"


üìä New York Times International Coverage Index (2024)
üéØ Purpose
This index measures whether the New York Times' international coverage volume corresponds to the economic significance of the world's top 20 economies.

üßÆ How the New York Times International Coverage Index is Calculated for 2024
Step 1: Count the mentions for each of the top 20 economies in the world (by GDP)

Step 2: Calculate the average of the top 20 country mentions

Step 3: Divide each country's mention count by the average of the top 20

This gives the New York Times International Coverage Index, where 1 = low coverage and 3 = high coverage.

üåç Economic Context
Your premise that China constitutes a major part of the global economy is well-founded. According to 2025 projections, China's nominal GDP is approximately $19.23 trillion, representing about 17% of the world's total GDP . This makes it the second-largest economy globally .

I hope this well-structured README is useful for your project. If you have the specific mention counts and calculated index values, I would be happy to help you visualize or analyze that data further.
